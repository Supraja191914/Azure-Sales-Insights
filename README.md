# Azure Sales Insights – End-to-End Data Engineering Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a simple end-to-end Azure Data Engineering project designed to showcase skills in Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Synapse Serverless, and Power BI.

The project ingests sales data (CSV) into Azure Data Lake Storage, processes it using Azure Data Factory, queries it using Synapse Serverless, and visualizes it in Power BI.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** – Data ingestion and transformation
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)** – Data storage
- **Azure Synapse Serverless** – Data querying
- **Power BI** – Data visualization
- **GitHub** – Version control and portfolio showcase

---

## 🚀 Steps
1. Upload raw CSV to ADLS `raw` container.
2. Use ADF to copy and clean data into `processed` container.
3. Query processed data in Synapse Serverless with SQL.
4. Create visuals in Power BI.
5. Commit all files, scripts, and screenshots to GitHub.
